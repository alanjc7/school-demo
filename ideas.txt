What are computers
What are applications
What is the internet

We can do everything on phones and computers - order shopping, send messages, play games, watch films, pay for things
The computers and phones need to know how to do things, they need some instructions.

'Code' or 'Programming' is writing the instructions in a language that the computer understands.
There are many languages. 
Today we will use Javascript - the most commonly used for websites and apps

One type of software engineering called 'web development' building web applications or applications
Frontend (what you see on the screen) // restaurant tafel
Backend (where the data comes from) // restaurant keuken
Communication over internet // when you go on an ipad, or a phone, or often when you watch something on tv you are using an app, and the data is all coming from the internet
